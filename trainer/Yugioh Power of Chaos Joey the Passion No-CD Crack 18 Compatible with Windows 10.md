# How to Play Yu-Gi-Oh! Power of Chaos: Joey the Passion Without CD
 
Yu-Gi-Oh! Power of Chaos: Joey the Passion is a strategy video game based on the popular anime and manga series Yu-Gi-Oh!. It is the third and final installment of the Power of Chaos series, following Yu-Gi-Oh! Power of Chaos: Yugi the Destiny and Yu-Gi-Oh! Power of Chaos: Kaiba the Revenge. In this game, you can duel against Joey Wheeler, one of Yugi's best friends and rivals, using hundreds of cards with different effects and strategies.
 
However, if you want to play this game on your Windows PC, you may encounter a problem: you need to insert the original CD every time you launch the game. This can be inconvenient and risky, as you may lose or damage your CD over time. Fortunately, there is a way to play Yu-Gi-Oh! Power of Chaos: Joey the Passion without CD, using a No-CD patch that allows you to run the game from your hard drive.

A No-CD patch is a modified version of the game's executable file that bypasses the CD check and lets you play without inserting the CD. To use a No-CD patch, you need to download it from a reliable source, such as GameBurnWorld[^1^], and replace your original game file with it. Here are the steps to do so:
 
1. Download the No-CD patch for Yu-Gi-Oh! Power of Chaos: Joey the Passion from GameBurnWorld[^1^]. Make sure you choose the version that matches your game's language and region.
2. Extract the No-CD patch file using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You should get a file named `YGO_POC_JTP.EXE`.
3. Locate your game's installation folder on your hard drive. It is usually in `C:\Program Files\KONAMI\Yu-Gi-Oh! Power of Chaos JOEY THE PASSION`.
4. Copy the No-CD patch file and paste it into your game's installation folder. You will be asked to overwrite the existing file. Click Yes to confirm.
5. Launch the game from your desktop shortcut or Start menu. You should be able to play without inserting the CD.

Note: Some antivirus programs may detect the No-CD patch as a virus or malware. This is a false positive, as the patch does not harm your computer or game. You may need to disable your antivirus or add an exception for the patch file before using it.
