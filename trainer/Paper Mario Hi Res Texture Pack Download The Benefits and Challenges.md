Paper Mario 64 is a classic RPG game that was released for the Nintendo 64 in 2000. The game features a unique paper-like art style that gives it a charming and whimsical look. However, the original textures of the game have not aged well and look blurry and pixelated on modern displays.
 
Fortunately, there is a way to enhance the graphics of Paper Mario 64 and make it look like a HD remake. Thanks to a fan-made project by BooLean and other contributors, you can download and install a custom HD texture pack that replaces the original textures with high-resolution ones that are faithful to the original art style.

In this article, we will show you how to download and install the Paper Mario 64 HD texture pack using the Dolphin emulator. Dolphin is a popular emulator that allows you to play GameCube and Wii games on your PC. You will need a copy of the Paper Mario 64 ROM file and a recent development version of Dolphin to use the texture pack.
 
## Step 1: Download the Paper Mario 64 HD Texture Pack
 
The first step is to download the Paper Mario 64 HD texture pack from this link: [https://mega.nz/file/PnBSHTAA#GCwY6zfvBidqZSMFQat0XaX61wia7LlJHUCU9GmZ4FU](https://mega.nz/file/PnBSHTAA#GCwY6zfvBidqZSMFQat0XaX61wia7LlJHUCU9GmZ4FU). This is a zip file that contains the DDS-BC7 format of the texture pack. DDS-BC7 is a compressed format that reduces the size of the texture pack without losing quality.
 
Once you have downloaded the zip file, extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You should see a folder named NAE inside. This is the folder that contains all the custom textures for Paper Mario 64.
 
## Step 2: Place the Texture Pack Folder in the Dolphin Directory
 
The next step is to place the NAE folder in the correct location in your Dolphin directory. Depending on your operating system, this location may vary. For Windows users, it is usually in "C:\Users\UserName\Documents\Dolphin Emulator\Load\Textures". For Linux users, it is usually in "~/.local/share/dolphin-emu/Load/Textures".

If you don't see these folders, you may need to create them manually. Make sure that the NAE folder is placed directly inside the Textures folder, not inside another subfolder.
 
## Step 3: Enable Custom Textures and Prefetching in Dolphin
 
The final step is to enable custom textures and prefetching in Dolphin. Custom textures allow Dolphin to load the HD textures instead of the original ones. Prefetching allows Dolphin to load all the custom textures into RAM before starting the game, which reduces stuttering and loading times.
 
To enable these options, open Dolphin and go to Graphics > Advanced. Check the boxes for "Load Custom Textures" and "Prefetch Custom Textures". You may also want to enable some form of anti-aliasing (such as SSAA or FXAA) to smooth out the edges of the textures.
 
## Step 4: Enjoy Paper Mario 64 in HD!
 
Now you are ready to enjoy Paper Mario 64 in HD! Launch the game from Dolphin and marvel at how much better it looks with the custom texture pack. You will notice that everything from the characters, environments, menus, items, and effects have been improved with higher resolution and more detail.
 
The Paper Mario 64 HD texture pack is essentially complete and covers the entire game from start to finish. However, there may still be some minor issues or missing textures that will be fixed in future updates.
